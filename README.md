# BeNeZe: A decision support tool for parasite management in kingfish aquaculture

A decision support tool was developed to aid management of problematic parasites in marine fish aquaculture. The tool provides biologically relevant treatment intervals to interrupt the life cycle of harmful ectoparasitic flukes that occur in global kingfish and amberjack (Seriola spp.) aquaculture. Temperature-dependent life cycle parameters for the skin flukes, Benedenia seriolae and Neobenedenia girellae, and the gill fluke, <i>Zeuxapta seriolae</i>, were derived from published and unpublished data and best fit for the models obtained with a power regression. Increasing temperatures shortened the lifespan of <i>B. seriolae</i> and <i>Z. seriolae</i>. Temperature similarly influenced <i>N. girellae</i>, but not time to last hatch. Salinity had no effect on the timing of parasite life cycle parameters. The tool, named BeNeZe [Benˈeasy] after the first two letters of each parasite genera, enables rapid determination of treatment intervals for medicinal immersion or ‘bathing’ treatments – the first to kill flukes attached to fish and the second to prevent maturity of new parasite recruits. As temperatures increase, the interval between treatments and duration where the treatment should be applied, is reduced. The current taxonomic status of <i>Seriola lalandi</i>, <i>B. seriolae</i>, <i>Z. seriolae</i>, and <i>N. girellae</i>, their global distribution and the inclusion of parasite biology and behaviour as part of an integrated management strategy are reviewed. Available through a phone app (BeNeZe (shorthand.com), BeNeZe is intended to be applied in conjunction with farm biosecurity, surveillance, management measures and recognition of independent management units. BeNeZe can be used to reduce infection burdens, improve fish welfare and production, and reduce treatment number and frequency.
